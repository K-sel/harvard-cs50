1.) Since the database only contains the listener’s top 100 songs from 2018, the aura can only reflect that single year. By averaging the values of energy, valence, and danceability across those songs, we obtain a snapshot of their musical mood in 2018. The result is limited to that year’s listening habits and cannot capture broader trends or changes over time.

2.) This method may not be very representative because it treats all songs equally, regardless of how often each was played. A song listened to hundreds of times should arguably influence the aura more than one played only once. In addition, the analysis is restricted to three quantitative factors (energy, valence, danceability) and ignores other dimensions of music that strongly shape mood, such as genre, lyrical content, or seasonal listening patterns. A better approach would incorporate play frequency, genre classification, and natural language processing of lyrics to capture the emotional and thematic content of the music.
